  <p>Create an empty HTML page and add the following functionality to it: when you click anywhere on the page,
    the browser logs to the console the X and Y coordinates of where you have clicked in the window. 
    For example, if you click in the top left corner of the page, the output will be 0 0 (or close to it).
    Use the click event.</p>
  <p>1. Create an empty HTML page and add the following functionality to it: when you click anywhere on the page,
    the browser logs to the console the X and Y coordinates of where you have clicked in the window. 
    For example, if you click in the top left corner of the page, the output will be 0 0 (or close to it).
    Use the click event.</p>
  <p>2. Create an empty HTML page and add the following functionality to it: every time you move the cursor,
    the browser continuously logs to the console the X and Y coordinates of where the cursor is now.
    Use the mousemove event.</p>
  <p>3. Create a page that works like described in #2, but only after the user clicks anywhere on the page.
    Before this initial click the page shouldnâ€™t output anything to the console.</p>
  <p>4. Create a page that prints 'down' to the console every time the left mouse button is pressed down and prints 'up' 
    every time the button is released. For instance, if you click anywhere on the page, you should get 'down' and then 'up' 
    in quick succession. If, on the other hand, you press the button and hold it for a while, you will see
    'down' in the console and then 'up' only after you do release it. Use the mousedown and mouseup events.</p>
